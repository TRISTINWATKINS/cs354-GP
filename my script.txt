Hi everyone, my name is Tristin, and my part of the project was covering the
documentation side of the Rust language—specifically how to install Rust,
where to find official references, and how to compile and run programs.

Rust’s documentation ecosystem is one of the strongest parts of the language.
The Rust Book, Rust by Example, and the official Reference together serve as
the primary specification for the language. Rust doesn’t have a single formal
specification—its behavior is defined through these documents and through the
compiler itself.

I also documented how to install Rust using rustup, which is the official tool
that manages toolchains, updates, and the compiler. It works the same on Linux,
Mac, and Windows, and once it’s installed you automatically get access to rustc,
Cargo, Clippy, and rustfmt.

I also demonstrated how compiling works using both rustc directly and Cargo.
Cargo is the tool most Rust programmers use because it handles packages,
dependencies, and builds automatically.

For my example programs, I wrote a simple Celsius-to-Fahrenheit converter to
show basic syntax, variables, and printing. My medium program was a basic
command-line todo list, which demonstrates user input, vectors, loops, and
match expressions—some of Rust’s most common features.

That's a summary of my portion, and I'll pass it on to the next team member.
